# Campus-Network
Cisco packet Tracer based Projects

I'm excited to share my latest networking project, where I designed and configured a Hierarchical Campus Network using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project showcases a comprehensive approach to modern network architecture and implementation.

✅ Key Highlights:

🧱 Hierarchical Network Design for scalability and manageability

🔌 Proper device cabling and connection setup

🧩 VLAN creation and port assignment to isolate traffic

🧠 IP Subnetting & Addressing for optimized network segmentation

🔁 Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick) for VLAN communication

📦 Router-based DHCP Server configuration

🔐 SSH Setup for secure remote access

📡 RIPv2 Protocol for dynamic routing

🔒 Port Security to secure access at the switch level

🖥️ Host device configurations

🔍 Network Testing & Verification

This hands-on project helped me reinforce practical networking skills crucial for real-world IT environments.
